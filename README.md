# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: the lack of a proper base case for negative inputs.  The `factorial` function provided in `bug.py` does not handle negative inputs correctly, leading to infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`. The solution in `bugSolution.py` addresses this by adding a check for negative inputs, handling them gracefully by raising a ValueError.
